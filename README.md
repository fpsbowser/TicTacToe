TicTacToe project utilizing modules and factories.
Functionally works but it doesn't look too pretty. I may come back to this at a later date and improve UI/UX and also improve
the functions that check for a winner. I think I should have used loops to loop through the gameboard to check if there was a winner but instead I used a lot of if else statements which isn't the best.
